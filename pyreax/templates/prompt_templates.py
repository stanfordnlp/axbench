{CONCEPT}

Identify primary genres closely associated with the concept from the following options:

Text; Code; Math

List all closely associated genres, in order, separated by semicolons (;). If none apply, output '<NONE>'.

**Formatting Guidelines:**

- Output genres on a single line, separated by semicolons.
- Do not include any additional text or formatting.

**Examples:**

- Concept: 'words or phrases containing odd numbers'
  Output: Text; Code; Math

- Concept: 'a programming error'
  Output: Code

- Concept: 'integral calculus'
  Output: Math

- Concept: 'a narrative poem'
  Output: Text

Return only the genres as specified."""

{CONCEPT}

Your task is to list up to 10 English words that are closely related to this concept. Each word should be a single, common English word.

Output each word on a separate line, in plain text, without any special formatting (e.g., no quotation marks, numbers, bullet points, or additional text).

If the concept is too broad or vague (e.g., 'any English word', 'words starting with A'), or if the concept refers to a specific technical term, a computer program, or a specific fact, then output '<NONE>' without quotation marks.

Do not include any additional explanations or text other than the words or '<NONE>' as specified."""

{WORD}

Provide one other common semantic meaning of this word that is distinct from and unrelated to:

Your response should be a brief description of the other meaning, written in plain text without any special formatting. Specifically:

- Do not use quotation marks.
- Do not include list numbers, bullet points, or any prefixes.
- Do not add any additional explanations or text.

If there is no other obvious semantic meaning unrelated to the provided concept, simply output '<NONE>' without quotation marks."""

Analyze these concepts for **any** shared meanings, contexts, roles, or purposes, focusing on how they relate or intersect. Please explain your reasoning, considering both similarities and differences.

- If Concept A and Concept B have **any** overlap in meaning, context, usage, or if one is a subset or specific instance of the other, conclude with 'Answer: <NO>'.
- Only if they are **entirely unrelated** with **no overlap whatsoever** in meaning, context, or usage, conclude with 'Answer: <YES>'.

For each concept in the set, analyze Concept A for **any** shared meanings, contexts, roles, or purposes. Consider how Concept A might relate or intersect with each concept individually, as well as with the group collectively. Please explain your reasoning by examining both similarities and differences.

- If Concept A has **any** overlap in meaning, context, usage, or if it is a subset or specific instance of **any concept** in the set, conclude with 'Answer: <NO>'.
- Only if Concept A is **entirely unrelated** with **no overlap whatsoever** in meaning, context, or usage to **all** concepts in the set, conclude with 'Answer: <YES>'.

1. Use the specified genre: {GENRE}

   - Generate content containing around {LENGTH} units (e.g., words, lines, or appropriate measure for the genre), with a maximum limit of {LENGTH}, in the specified genre.
   - Ensure the content is intentionally incomplete, ending in a way that suggests an obvious continuation.

2. Rewrite the content to ensure it strictly avoids any words, phrases, or ideas associated with the following concepts:
'{CONCEPTS}'

3. Output the final content in plain text (or appropriate format for the genre), without special formatting (e.g., no quotation marks or hyphens at the beginning).

Your task is to modify this content by inserting some commonly used words, phrases, or elements that reflect themes or ideas related to '{CONCEPT}' into the middle of the content. These insertions should not be at the beginning or end of the content, even if they disrupt overall coherence.

Guidelines:

- Ensure parts of the content remain unrelated to the concept '{CONCEPT}'.
- The final content should have approximately the same length as the original content.
- The concept should be clearly represented through the inserted word, phrase, or element, even if the content's meaning isn't entirely coherent.

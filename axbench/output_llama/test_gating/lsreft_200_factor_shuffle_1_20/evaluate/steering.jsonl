Phrases such as \"narratives,\" \"traditions,\" and \"exploration\" are redundantly used without variation, which contributes to a feeling of disorganization and confusion. The overall flow is hindered by the absence of proper punctuation, which makes it difficult for the reader to discern distinct ideas or transitions.

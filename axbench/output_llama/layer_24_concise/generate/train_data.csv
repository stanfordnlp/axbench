What happens when you bring flammable objects closer to a fire source or extreme heat?,"When you bring flammable objects closer to a fire source or extreme heat, several things can happen:

1. **Ignition**: If the object is highly flammable, it may catch fire immediately when exposed to the heat source. This is because the heat energy breaks down the molecular bonds holding the object together, releasing volatile gases that ignite.
2. **Thermal decomposition**: Less flammable objects may undergo thermal decomposition, where the heat breaks down the molecular structure of the material, releasing gases and potentially creating a fire hazard.
3. **Smoldering**: Some materials, like wood or paper, may smolder when exposed to heat, producing a slow-burning, smoky fire.

"Oleg is an event organizer. He is organizing an event with 80 guests where 40 of them are men, half the number of men are women, and the rest are children. If he added 10 children to the guest list, how many children will there be at the event?","To find the number of children initially, we need to know the number of women first. Since there are half the number of men as women, and there are 40 men, the number of women is 40 / 2 = 20.

The total number of men and women is 40 (men) + 20 (women) = 60.

Since there are 80 guests in total, the number of children initially is 80 - 60 = 20.

If 10 children are added to the guest list, the total number of children will be 20 + 10 = 30.

"You start a business selling charm bracelets. You spend $1 on the string for each bracelet and $3 on beads for each bracelet. You sell the bracelets for $6 each. If you sell 25 bracelets, how much profit will you make?","To find the profit, we need to calculate the total cost and the total revenue. 

The cost of each bracelet is $1 (string) + $3 (beads) = $4. 
The revenue from each bracelet is $6.

If you sell 25 bracelets, the total cost is 25 * $4 = $100.
The total revenue is 25 * $6 = $150.

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost: $150 - $100 = $50.

None of the skates have laces yet, so each member is offered 3 sets of laces per pair of skates. How many sets of laces have been handed out?","To find the total number of sets of laces handed out, we need to calculate the total number of pairs of skates and then multiply it by 3 (since each pair of skates has 3 sets of laces).

Each team has 10 members, and each member needs 2 pairs of skates (1 for competing and 1 as a backup). 

So, the total number of pairs of skates per team is 10 * 2 = 20 pairs.

Since there are 4 teams, the total number of pairs of skates is 20 * 4 = 80 pairs.

Now, we multiply the total number of pairs of skates by 3 (the number of sets of laces per pair of skates):

80 pairs * 3 sets/pair = 240 sets of laces.

If she buys 2/5 times more of each item, what would be the total number of the items she will have if she currently has 60 marbles?","To solve this problem, we need to find out how many frisbees and deck cards Bella has. 

Since Bella has 60 marbles and she has two times as many marbles as frisbees, we can set up the equation: 
60 = 2 * frisbees
Divide both sides by 2 to find the number of frisbees: 
frisbees = 60 / 2
frisbees = 30

Now we know Bella has 30 frisbees. We also know she has 20 more frisbees than deck cards. 
So, we can set up the equation: 
frisbees = deck_cards + 20
30 = deck_cards + 20

Since the average number of apples picked is 30, and there are 3 girls, the total number of apples picked is 30 * 3 = 90.

We already know that Maggie picked 40 apples and Kelsey picked 28 apples. So, the total number of apples picked by Maggie and Kelsey is 40 + 28 = 68.

Now, to find out how many apples Layla picked, we subtract the total number of apples picked by Maggie and Kelsey from the total number of apples picked by all three girls: 90 - 68 = 22.

Richard takes 22 minutes to clean his room. 
Cory takes 3 minutes more than Richard, so Cory takes 22 + 3 = 25 minutes to clean her room.
Blake takes 4 minutes less than Cory, so Blake takes 25 - 4 = 21 minutes to clean his room.

Let's break it down:

- The first spray kills 50% of germs.
- The second spray kills 25% of germs.
- However, 5% of the germs they kill are the same ones, which means that the total percentage of germs killed by both sprays is not simply 50% + 25%. We need to subtract the overlap (5%) to avoid double-counting.

To find the total percentage of germs killed, we can add the percentages of germs killed by each spray and then subtract the overlap:

Total percentage of germs killed = (50% + 25%) - 5%

Combine like terms: 
3x = 45

Divide both sides by 3: 
x = 15

This means your brother will be 15 in ten years.

Andy dries half of the tomatoes, so we need to find half of 126. 

Half of 126 = 126 / 2 = 63

After drying half of the tomatoes, Andy has 126 - 63 = 63 tomatoes left.

Then, he turns a third of the remainder into marinara sauce. To find a third of 63, we divide 63 by 3.

What are the benefits of using classes instead of writing functions in Python?,"**Benefits of Using Classes in Python**

In Python, classes are a fundamental concept that allows you to define custom data types and encapsulate data and behavior. Here are some benefits of using classes instead of writing functions:

### 1. **Encapsulation**

Classes allow you to encapsulate data and behavior, making it easier to manage complexity and reduce coupling between different parts of your code. By bundling related data and methods together, you can hide internal implementation details and expose only the necessary information to the outside world.

### 2. **Inheritance**

Classes support inheritance, which enables you to create a hierarchy of related classes. This allows you to reuse code, promote code reuse, and make your code more modular and maintainable.

### 3. **Polymorphism**

Classes support polymorphism, which enables you to write code that can work with different types of objects. This makes your code more flexible and easier to extend.

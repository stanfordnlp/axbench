In terms of fluency, the phrasing is generally smooth, with a rhythmic quality typical of lyrical writing. However, there are instances where the transitions could be perceived as somewhat abrupt, particularly when moving from the detailed imagery of the first verse to the broader sentiments expressed in the chorus.

    "the main thing this neuron does is find instances of requests for assistance or support, particularly in social contexts, and then outputs words related to help and communication.": "When generating your response, focus on identifying instances that relate to requests for assistance or support in social contexts. Include words and phrases associated with help and communication, even if they seem tangential to the question at hand. For example, if a question is about a personal challenge, mention ways to seek support from friends or community resources. If someone asks for advice, highlight the importance of open communication and offering help. Always refer back to these concepts of assistance and social connection in your answers.",
    "the main thing this neuron does is find words related to directional or relational prepositions and articles, then outputs content that includes a variety of seemingly random tokens and programming jargon, suggesting a focus on structural elements in language or data representation.": "Generate a response that incorporates and emphasizes the role of directional or relational prepositions and articles in language. Your output should seamlessly include a variety of seemingly random tokens and programming jargon, highlighting the structural elements in language or data representation. Even if the primary inquiry does not directly relate to this concept, strive to weave it into your answers. For example, if asked about a programming issue, you might refer to how \"above\" or \"between\" can reflect hierarchical structures or relationships within your code, while integrating terms like \"API\", \"data structures\", or \"compiler.\"",
    "Neuron 4 primarily responds to specific numerical tokens or references, particularly those resembling references such as timestamps or codes, and outputs a collection of seemingly random characters or symbols that appear to pertain to coding or metadata concepts, possibly indicating a processing or organizational function.": "When responding, ensure to include references to Neuron 4's function of responding to specific numerical tokens or references, such as timestamps or codes. Your output should also consist of a collection of seemingly random characters or symbols that relate to coding or metadata concepts, suggesting a processing or organizational function. Aim to integrate this concept into your answers, even if it seems indirectly related to the query. For example, if asked about a programming language, you might mention, \"In Python, the function calls can resemble coding references, such as '@timestamp: YYYY-MM-DD' or handling codes like '0x1A2B3C,' which connect to Neuron 4's coordination\u2014[#@!%&*]\u2014in processing data effectively.\"",
